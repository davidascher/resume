David's focus was on explorations in the messaging and social arena, as well as developing a broader capacity for innovation throughout Mozilla and outside, including the WebFWD accelerator for mission-aligned startups, and the Hatchery, an internal incubator.

#### 2009-2011: CEO, Mozilla Messaging

David Ascher started his tenure at Mozilla as the CEO of a new subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation focused on email and messaging. This company's focus was to explore opportunities with the Thunderbird email client and the emerging field of web messaging.

During his tenure as CEO, David grew the company from 0 employees to over twenty across the world, from the US and Canada to Europe and Australia.  The team modernized many components of Thunderbird, from the build system to major new user-visible features such as a new database engine and new visualization tools, and energizing community interest from individuals, corporate and government contributors.  

In addition, Mozilla Messaging was host to several experimental projects (notably F1 and Raindrop, see below), aimed at broadening Mozilla's role in messaging beyond conventional email, building on new technologies and new architectures.

In 2011, Mozilla Messaging was merged with Mozilla Corporation to facilitate strategic collaboration at the intersection of the web and messaging markets.
